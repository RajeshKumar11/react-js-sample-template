Here are the Docker commands to create a build and start the React application using the provided Dockerfile:

### 1. **Build the Docker Image**
Run the following command to build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build --no-cache -t react-app .
```

### 2. **Run the Docker Container**
Run the container using the built image:
```bash
docker run -p 80:80 react-app
```

This maps port 80 of the container to port 80 of your local machine. You can then access the React application in your browser at `http://localhost`.

### Notes
- Ensure `serve` is installed and included in your build stage. If it's not, you can add a step to install it in the `build` stage:
  ```dockerfile
  RUN npm install -g serve
  ```
- If you encounter any issues, verify that the `build` directory exists after the `npm run build` command and that the `serve` command can locate it.
